# Amplitude-Modulation-and-demodulation-an-adding-noise-AWGN-to-it
I have amplitude modulated a message signal(Low frequency) using a carrier signal of high frequency. The modulation done is DSB-FC Modulation i.e, Double Side Band-Full carrier. After amplitude modulation, I have added an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) to it.
